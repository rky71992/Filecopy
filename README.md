# Filecopy
Automatically copy files from one dir to another 
Hi, I am new to python and many things, which means this code will have some bottlenecks and you can point them out for better output.

Now, this code uses Inotify to detect an event on a dir and can can perform operation depending on that.
for more information about Inotify check its documentation @ https://linux.die.net/man/7/inotify
